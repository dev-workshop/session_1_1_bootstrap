#Dev Workshop Indy
##Session 1.1 Twitter Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework created by Twitter for faster and easier web development. It encourages semantic HTML, uses a robust set of CSS classes to command an amazingly sturdy cross browser experience. It comes pre-packed with enough custom components to get your project off to a good start and sports some rock solid documentation. All for free.

In this workshop we will show you how to set up Bootstrap, use it's grid based layout, components, and libraries. If we have time we might add in a few extra JS libraries to expand Bootstrap and take a peek at the programatic CSS source code called LESS.
